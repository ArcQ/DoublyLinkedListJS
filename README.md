_No Grunt/Gulp required!_

**Work in Progress**

Boilerplate for building a client-based JavaScript library in ES6 using the following components:

* Babel
* Webpack

* Karma
* Istanbul with Isparta
* ESLint with eslint-config-airbnb

## Current Issues
* Code coverage from Isparta is not returning the correct statement, methods and line counts.
